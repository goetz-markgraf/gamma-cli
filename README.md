# how to use gamma CLI

## invoke with a gamma file

You can call the CLI with a location of a `.gma`-File as a parameter. The file is then parsed, executed and the
result of the last expression printed out as the result of the script.

## Use the CLI as a REPL

If you start the CLI without any parameter, you will be greeted with a REPL. You can then
type gamma code and have it executed with the command `.` (a single dot on the input line).

Type `.help` for more commands
